    An internship is a period of work experience offered by an organization
    for a limited period of time.[1] Once confined to medical graduates,
    internship is used practice for a wide range of placements in
    businesses, <br>non-profit organizations and government agencies. They
    are typically undertaken by students and graduates looking to gain
    relevant <br>skills and experience in a particular field. Employers
    benefit from these placements because they often recruit <br>employees
    from their best interns, who have known capabilities, thus saving time
    and money in the long run. <br>Internships are usually arranged by
    third-party organizations that recruit interns on behalf of industry
    groups.
